description: "We spent a lovely (albeit chilly) two hours today on a fabulous Mid-Century Modern (MCM) building tour of downtown Calgary. Put on by the Calgary Heritage Initiative (CHI) and sponsored by the Esker Foundation, it was a fantastic little history lesson about some of the buildings that we walk by every day and often don't take the time to stop and take a really good look at."
